## Versioning

Version numbering follows the Semantic versioning approach. However, if the major version is `0`, the code is considered alpha and breaking changes may occur as a minor update.

## License

We’re using the MIT license for 3 reasons:
1. We're here to share useful code. You may use any part of it freely, as the MIT license allows. 
2. A library is no place for viral licensing.
3. Ease of use. Forking code files or snippets for essential tooling shouldn't require a license transfer.
